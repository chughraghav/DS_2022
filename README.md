## Day 1
___
### Problem 1
You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k.
Return whether there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.

Example:\
Given [4, 7, 1 , -3, 2] and k = 5,\
return true since 4 + 1 = 5.

Try to do it in a single pass of the list.

___
### Problem 2
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
  
Example:  
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

### Problem 1
#### Squares in Rectangle  
Given dimensions of rectangle, you need to find least possible squares that can make complete rectangle.  

Input format  
- First line will contain two integers, length L and breath B of rectangle(not in order)  

Output format
- Print side of square followed by number of squares, for each different square on new line. 

Example:  
Sample Input : 5 3  
Sample Output:   
3 1  
2 1  
1 2

### Problem 2
#### Max min difference

You are given an array of N integers.
You have to find the Difference of Maximum and Minimum sum of exactly K numbers from the array.
If not possible then print -1.  

Sample Input:  
k = 3  
numbers = [1, 8, 3, 2, 6, 4 , 12]

Output:  
19  
Max sum is 12 + 8 + 6 = 26.
Min sum is 1+ 2 + 4 = 7. 
Difference is 26 - 7 = 19.
