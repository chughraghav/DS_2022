### Problem 1
You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k.
Return whether there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.

Example:\
Given [4, 7, 1 , -3, 2] and k = 5,\
return true since 4 + 1 = 5.

Try to do it in a single pass of the list.

___
### Problem 2
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s,
find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s.
If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example:\
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]\
Output: 2\
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
